<h2>Function composition</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>In this topic, you will learn a new technique for working with functions called <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3580" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, function composition is a technique for combining functions to create more complex functions, building upon a concept from mathematics. | It can be viewed as a design pattern in functional programming. You can use this pattern to compose standard functions, operators, predicates, and consumers (but not suppliers). Function composition allows developers to build new functions from existing ones and use them whenever required. Methods for composing functions, predicates, consumers, and operators (excluding suppliers) are available for this purpose. Function composition enables the creation of a chain of operations, such as consuming a value several times using the `andThen` method, which returns a new consumer that consumes the given value in sequence.">function composition</a></strong>. It is a mechanism for combining functions to obtain more complicated functions that originally comes from math. In a sense, it can be considered as a <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3580" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a design pattern is a reusable solution to a common problem that occurs in software design. | It provides a general template for how to solve a problem, rather than a specific implementation. The Strategy pattern, for example, is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one in a separate class, and makes them interchangeable within that family. This allows for easier addition of new algorithms and more concise code, by moving algorithm execution into their own classes. The Command pattern, another behavioral design pattern, decouples the logic between a command and its consumer by encapsulating all the data related to a command in one object.">design pattern</a></strong> in functional programming. You can use this pattern to compose standard functions, operators, predicates and consumers (but not suppliers). Let's take a look at examples.</p>
<h5 id="composing-functions" style="text-align: center;">Composing functions</h5>
<p>The <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3580" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a functional interface is a special kind of interface that contains a single abstract method, although it can also contain default, static, and non-abstract methods. | A functional interface can be implemented and instantiated using a lambda expression or a method reference. The Java compiler automatically creates a special hidden class for lambda expressions and method references. The annotation can be used to force checking whether an interface satisfies the requirement of the functional interface. The concept of functional interfaces is an essential part of functional programming in Java, which is built on top of object-oriented programming (OOP), especially interfaces and polymorphism.">functional interface</a><strong> </strong><code class="language-java">Function&lt;T, R&gt;</code><strong> </strong>has two <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3580" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a default method is a method that has a default implementation in an interface, which is provided using the default modifier. | They were introduced to provide backward compatibility, allowing new methods to be added to existing interfaces without affecting the classes that implement them. If a class implements multiple interfaces with default methods having the same signature, the class must define the method to resolve the diamond problem. Default methods can be accessed from the implementing class and are a type of method along with abstract and static methods.">default methods</a> <code class="language-java">compose</code> and <code class="language-java">andThen</code> for composing new functions. The main difference between these methods lies in the execution order.</p>
<p>Generally, <code class="language-java">f.compose(g).apply(x)</code> is the same as <code class="language-java">f(g(x))</code><strong>,</strong> and <code class="language-java">f.andThen(g).apply(x)</code> is the same as <code class="language-java">g(f(x))</code>.</p>
<p>Here is an example with two functions: <code class="language-java">adder</code> and <code class="language-java">multiplier</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Function&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; adder = x -&gt; x + 10;
Function&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; multiplier = x -&gt; x * 5;

// compose: adder(multiplier(5))
System.out.println("result: " + adder.compose(multiplier).apply(5));

// andThen: multiplier(adder(5))
System.out.println("result: " + adder.andThen(multiplier).apply(5));</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the <code class="language-java">compose</code> method returns a composed function that first applies <code class="language-java">multiplier</code><strong> </strong>to its input, and then applies <code class="language-java">adder</code> to the result. The <code class="language-java">andThen</code><strong> </strong> method returns a composed function that first applies<strong> </strong><code class="language-java">adder</code> to its input, and then applies <code class="language-java">multiplier</code> to the result.</p>
<p>Here is the output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-applescript">result: 35
result: 75</code></pre>
<p>Operators can be used in the same way as functions.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary">The methods <code class="language-java">compose</code> and <code class="language-java">andThen</code> do not modify the functions that are combined. Instead, they return new functions. This is true for all the next examples.</div>
<p></p>
<h5 id="composing-predicates" style="text-align: center;">Composing predicates</h5>
<p>All functional interfaces representing predicates (<code class="language-java">Predicate&lt;T&gt;</code>, <code class="language-java">IntPredicate</code> and others) have three methods for composing new predicates: <code class="language-java">and</code>, <code class="language-java">or</code> and <code class="language-java">negate</code>.</p>
<p>There are two predicates in the example below:<strong> </strong><code class="language-java">isOdd</code> and <code class="language-java">lessThan11</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">IntPredicate isOdd = n -&gt; n % 2 != 0; // it's true for 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and so on

System.out.println(isOdd.test(10)); // prints "false"
System.out.println(isOdd.test(11)); // prints "true"
        
IntPredicate lessThan11 = n -&gt; n &lt; 11; // it's true for all numbers &lt; 11

System.out.println(lessThan11.test(10)); // prints "true"
System.out.println(lessThan11.test(11)); // prints "false"</code></pre>
<p>Let's negate the first predicate:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">IntPredicate isEven = isOdd.negate(); // it's true for 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and so on
System.out.println(isEven.test(10)); // prints "true"
System.out.println(isEven.test(11)); // prints "false"</code></pre>
<p>Here we have a new predicate that tests whether the value is even rather than odd.</p>
<p>Now let's combine both <code class="language-java">isOdd</code> and <code class="language-java">lessThan11</code> predicates together by using <code class="language-java">or</code> and <code class="language-java">and</code> methods:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">IntPredicate isOddOrLessThan11 = isOdd.or(lessThan11);

System.out.println(isOddOrLessThan11.test(10)); // prints "true"
System.out.println(isOddOrLessThan11.test(11)); // prints "true"
System.out.println(isOddOrLessThan11.test(12)); // prints "false"
System.out.println(isOddOrLessThan11.test(13)); // prints "true"

IntPredicate isOddAndLessThan11 = isOdd.and(lessThan11);

System.out.println(isOddAndLessThan11.test(8));  // prints "false"
System.out.println(isOddAndLessThan11.test(9));  // prints "true"
System.out.println(isOddAndLessThan11.test(10)); // prints "false"
System.out.println(isOddAndLessThan11.test(11)); // prints "false"
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, these methods are equivalent to <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3580" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, logical operators are symbols used to combine or negate Boolean expressions. | There are four logical operators in Java: `!` (not), `&amp;&amp;` (and), `` (or), and `^` (xor). The `!` operator negates the Boolean value, while `&amp;&amp;` and `` return true if both, at least one, or exactly one of the operands are true, respectively. The xor operator, `^`, is used less frequently and returns true if the operands have different values. Logical operators are often used to build complex logical expressions that consider multiple factors.">logical operators</a> <code class="language-java">&amp;&amp;</code> and <code class="language-java">||</code>, but they work with functions rather than their values.</p>
<h5 id="composing-consumers" style="text-align: center;">Composing consumers</h5>
<p>It can be a little surprising, but it is also possible to combine consumers by using the <code class="language-java">andThen</code> method. It just returns a new consumer that consumes the given value several times in a chain.</p>
<p>In the following example, we use <code class="language-java">andThen</code> to print a value two times, but it is possible to do it more times.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Consumer&lt;String&gt; consumer = System.out::println;
Consumer&lt;String&gt; doubleConsumer = consumer.andThen(System.out::println);
doubleConsumer.accept("Hi!");</code></pre>
<p>Here is the output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Hi!
Hi!
</code></pre>
<p>In a real situation, you could use it to output a value to different destinations, like a database or a logger.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">Although it is possible to combine <strong>consumers</strong>, it is not possible to combine <strong>suppliers</strong>.</div>
<p></p>
<h5 id="conclusion" style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h5>
<p>Function composition allows developers to build new functions from existing ones and use them whenever you want. All kinds of predicates, functions, operators, and consumers (except for suppliers) have methods for that purpose.</p>
