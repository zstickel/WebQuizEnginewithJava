What amazing and helpful Java application are you going to create?</p>
<h5 id="a-sample-of-java">A sample of Java</h5>
<p>Let's start with the classic "Hello, World!" program, a friendly greeting from your computer:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
