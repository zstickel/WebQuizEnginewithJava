<h2>Retrieving Class instances</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>The <code class="language-java">java.lang.Class</code> takes a central place in the reflection package. It represents a structure of classes and interfaces by aggregating information on constructors, fields, methods, superclasses, interfaces, and so on. In other words, if you have an instance of a class of a specific type, you can obtain all information about the type. That's why <code class="language-java">java.lang.Class</code> is so important. There are several ways to get an object representing a <code class="language-java">java.lang.Class</code> depending on whether the code has access to an instance of the class, the name of the class, the type, or an existing <code class="language-java">Class</code>. Let's take a closer look at them!</p>
<h5 id="the-class-syntax" style="text-align: center;">The .class Syntax</h5>
<p>To retrieve a <code class="language-java">Class</code> instance for a given type we can use <code class="language-java">.class</code> construction:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Class stringClass = String.class;</code></pre>
<p>The <code class="language-java">.class</code> is simply added to the name of the type. This way of obtaining a <code class="language-java">Class</code> object is useful if we don't have any instances of the class available.</p>
<p>This is also the easiest way to obtain the <code class="language-java">Class</code> for a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3554" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a primitive type is one of eight built-in data types provided by the language. | They are represented by keywords and are not objects, unlike reference types. Primitive types are divided into groups based on their meaning, and each group operates similarly but has different sizes and ranges of value. The most commonly used primitive type is `int`, which represents an integer number. Java also provides several types for integer and fractional numbers, which are often used in arithmetic expressions. Primitive types store their value directly, unlike reference types that store a reference to an object located elsewhere.">primitive type</a> and even <code class="language-java">void</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Class intClass = int.class;
Class voidClass = void.class;</code></pre>
<h5 id="retrieve-class-from-an-object-instance" style="text-align: center;">Retrieve Class from an object instance</h5>
<p>The class <code class="language-java">Object</code>, the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3554" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a base class, also known as a superclass or parent class, is a class that is extended by another class, known as a subclass or derived class. | It serves as a blueprint for the subclass, providing it with inherited fields and methods. A parent class can have multiple child classes, but a child class can only have one parent class due to Java's single inheritance feature. The parent class reference can be used to refer to any subclass object derived from that superclass. An abstract class is often used as a base class in a hierarchy, and it represents an abstract concept that is used as a base class for subclasses.">base class</a> for any <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3554" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a reference type is a type of variable that stores a reference to an object located elsewhere in memory, rather than storing the object's value directly. | When an object is created using the new operator, it returns a reference to the location of the object in memory, allowing access to its fields and methods. Reference types can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to methods, and returned as values from methods. They are important for creating complex, object-oriented programs in Java. Unlike primitive types, which store their values directly, reference types store a reference to an object. When comparing reference types using the == operator, it compares the references (memory addresses) rather than the actual values. Additionally, assigning one value of a reference variable to another creates a copy of the reference, rather than the value itself. Reference types can also refer to a special value that represents the fact that it is not initialized yet or does not have a value. It is important to note that in Java, the heap is the region of memory where objects are stored and allocated dynamically during runtime.">reference type</a>, has a getClass method. To get <code class="language-java">Class</code> of a given instance, it's enough to call this method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Class instanceClass = "abc".getClass();</code></pre>
<p>Don't forget that this only works for reference types since they inherit from <code class="language-java">Object</code>! For primitive types, you might want to use other methods.</p>
<h5 id="retrieve-class-with-a-given-name" style="text-align: center;">Retrieve Class with a given name</h5>
<p>If we have access to a fully qualified type name, we can obtain the corresponding <code class="language-java">Class</code> using the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3554" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a static method is a method that is associated with a class rather than an instance of a class. | It can be accessed directly using the class name and does not require the creation of a class instance. A static method can only access static fields and other static methods within the same class, and cannot refer to the `this` keyword because there is no instance context. Static methods are often used as utility methods that provide common functionality for the entire project. They can be called from instance methods, but not the other way around.">static method</a> <code class="language-java">Class.forName</code>. Keep in mind that this method cannot be used for primitive types!</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Class forName = Class.forName("java.lang.String");</code></pre>
<p>This method can also be used to retrieve <code class="language-java">Class</code> objects for array classes. In this case, the name consists of the name of the element type preceded by one or more <strong>[</strong> characters representing the depth of the array nesting. The element types are encoded in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>boolean – Z</li>
<li>byte – B</li>
<li>char – C</li>
<li>class or interface – L<em>classname;</em></li>
<li>double – D</li>
<li>float – F</li>
<li>int – I</li>
<li>long – J</li>
<li>short – S</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-java">Class floatArrayClass = Class.forName("[F");
Class objectArrayClass = Class.forName("[[Ljava.lang.Object;");
Class scannerArrayClass = Class.forName("[Ljava.util.Scanner;");</code></pre>
<p>The variable <code class="language-java">floatArrayClass</code> will contain the <code class="language-java">Class</code> corresponding to a one-dimensional array of primitive type float (the same as <code class="language-java">float[].class</code>).

Every variable has a unique name, also known as an identifier, which is used to access its value. Variables can be declared and initialized in a single statement, and their value can be accessed and modified using the name. It's important to note that variables can be changed, meaning you can assign a new value to a variable without having to declare it again.">variable</a> <code class="language-java">objectArrayClass</code> in its turn will contain the <code class="language-java">Class</code> corresponding to a two-dimensional array of <code class="language-java">Object</code>. Note, that there should be a semicolon <code class="language-java">;</code> after an array of any objects.</p>
<h5 id="methods-that-return-classes" style="text-align: center;">Methods that Return Classes</h5>
<p>In addition to the methods we've described above, we can use some Reflection APIs to get classes. However, you should keep in mind that they can be used only if a  <code class="language-java">Class</code> has already been obtained. </p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">// Returns the super class for the given class
String.class.getSuperclass();

// Returns all the public classes, interfaces, and enums that are members of the class
String.class.getClasses();

// Returns all of the classes, interfaces, and enums that are explicitly declared in this class.
String.class.getDeclaredClasses();</code></pre>
<h5 id="getting-class-by-name" style="text-align: center;">Getting class by name</h5>
<p>We have covered the two methods for obtaining a class by name. Let's sum up their pros and cons.</p>
<p>The first way is getting a class directly, for instance <code class="language-java">String.class</code>. It looks simple but means that we're aware of a class at the compile time.</p>
<p>The second way is by using the method <code class="language-java">forName</code> of <code class="language-java">Class</code>, for instance <code class="language-java">Class.forName("java.lang.String")</code>. This way works at runtime as well as it can be used when a target class name is resolved dynamically, for example, retrieved from a config.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion" style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h5>
<p><code class="language-java">java.lang.Class</code> aggregates all the information that describes a given type. That is the reason why it is important to know ways of getting an instance of the class. If a class name is known, there are two ways of getting an instance of <code class="language-java">java.lang.Class</code>: calling <code class="language-java">ClassName.class</code> directly or getting <code class="language-java">Class.forName("package.ClassName")</code>. The alternative ways are based on having a reference to a class. For example, if you have an object, you can obtain its class as well.</p>
